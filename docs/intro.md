# CS Fundamentals Wiki

Welcome to my comprehensive guide to **Computer Science Fundamentals**! This wiki covers everything from JVM internals to distributed systems, with a focus on **production-ready knowledge** that you can apply in real-world scenarios.

:::tip Why This Matters
These aren't just theoretical concepts—every topic here includes production examples, performance benchmarks, and best practices learned from building scalable systems.
:::

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

This wiki is organized into 17 major topics, progressing from foundational concepts to advanced distributed systems:

- **[Java & JVM](./01-java-jvm-internals/01-intro.md)** - Memory model, GC tuning, concurrency ✅
- **[DBMS](./02-dbms-data-persistence/01-intro.md)** - Indexing, transactions, query optimization ✅
- **Spring Boot** - Framework internals, best practices 🚧
- **Security** - Authentication, authorization, cryptography 🚧

### System Fundamentals
- **Operating Systems** - Processes, threads, memory management 🚧
- **Networks** - TCP/IP, HTTP, load balancing 🚧
- **Cross Cutting Concerns** - Logging, monitoring, observability 🚧

### Distributed Systems
- **Distributed Systems** - CAP theorem, consensus, replication 🚧
- **Caching** - Redis, cache strategies, invalidation 🚧
- **Message Queues** - Kafka, RabbitMQ, event-driven architecture 🚧
- **Microservices** - Patterns, service mesh, resilience 🚧

### Design & Best Practices
- **API Design** - REST, GraphQL, versioning 🚧
- **Testing** - Unit, integration, E2E testing 🚧
- **CI/CD & DevOps** - Docker, Kubernetes, pipelines 🚧

### Advanced Topics
- **Java 8+ Features** - Streams, lambdas, modules 🚧
